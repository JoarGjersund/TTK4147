task A 

(sleep)
real	0m1.001s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.000s

busy wait (clock_gettime)

real	0m1.001s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m1.004s


busy wait (times)

real	0m0.998s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.996s


The first busy wait uses barely no system time because it is not performing any computation while in the sleep state.
The busy wait is constantly polling the system time and writing/reading to and from memory.
