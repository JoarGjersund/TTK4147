task d1
System run out of ram so it starts using the disk as ram, which is much slower (therefore computer appears to freeze)
Swap is the space that is used on the disk (swaping inactive pages from ram to disk when ram is full)

task d2
100: 100% ram used
1000: 60% ram used
10000: < 20% ram used

probably has to do with the page size and how the system is only capable of allocating pages of memory, so with smaller x-dimension
more pages are needed to store the matrix because the full page is not used. 


task d3
when writing zeros to memory we overwrite what is allready there (stuff allocated by the system), so the system freezes because it has to refetch the data from disk.
